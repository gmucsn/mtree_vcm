## Human Subject VCM example

### Running

To run this, you will need to ensure that you start using the `mTree_developer_server` in this directory. Once there, you open a web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ This will let you log in to the admin side of the server. The password for the admin section will be whatever you have configured in the `mtree_config.json` file. 

Once you are in the web interface, click on the 'Human Subject Controller' on the left hand side. Then select the human subject configuration you would like to run. Then hit the 'Run' button. You can now have your subject interfaces start.

### Starting a Subject

Open a new web browser tab/window and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/subjects/

There, you will need to enter a subject id. You can use one of the ones available in the mtree_config.json file. You will want to ensure that subject ids don't conflict.

### Starting the session

After your subjects are available in the session screen, you will simply hit the green "Start" button in the admin panel. This will start the experiment and the subjects screens should be activated.
